# Deep Neural Network for Malaria Infected Cell Recognition

## AIM

To develop a deep neural network for Malaria infected cell recognition and to analyze the performance.

## Problem Statement and Dataset

Malaria is a deadly, infectious mosquito-borne disease caused by Plasmodium parasites. These parasites are transmitted by the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Here we use a deep learning technique called CNN to automatically extract the feautures from the cell image and automatically learn useful knowledge that is used to classify the cells as parasatized or uninfected.
The dataset is created by Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications (LHNCBC), part of National Library of Medicine (NLM).They have carefully collected and annotated this dataset of healthy and infected blood smear images.
